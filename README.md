## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (preferred package manager)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/phellowseven/phellow-community.git
   cd phellow-community
   ```
2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the variables as needed.
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

### Launch a demo

If you don't have an OAuth Provider or data repository available, you can use the mock services
provided.

To launch a mock OIDC Provider, run:

```bash
pnpm run mock:oidc
```

To provide sample FHIR data to the application, you can launch [Mockoon](https://mockoon.com/) with
the config at `samples/mockooon.json`.

You can use one of the `.env.mockoon.*` files for the environment variables, depending on how you
launch the demo (either locally or via docker).

Then start the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

If you have Docker available on your system, you can use `docker-compose` with the
`docker-compose.sample.yaml` config to quickly launch a demo system:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.sample.yaml up -d
```

## Usage

- Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (default Vite port).
- Patients can log in to view their data

For detailed usage instructions, refer to the [docs](/docs/) directory.
